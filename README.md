# Wrodpress theme for nithinbekal.com

This repo contains the Wordpress theme I'm using in my blog, nithinbekal.com.
Feel free to customize the theme for yourself if you like it, but remember that
there are a few hardcoded links that you need to change yourself (like the ones
to twitter, github etc.)

## Using Google analytics

If you wish to use Google analytics with this theme, all you need to do is 
create a file called analytics.php and put your analytics code there. The
Google analytics js will appear in the header.

The analytics.php file is in the .gitignore list so there isn't a risk of 
someone accidentally including my analytics js on their site.
